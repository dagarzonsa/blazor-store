# BlazorStoreApp üõí

Welcome to **BlazorStoreApp**! This is an online store project built with **Blazor WebAssembly** and .NET 6, designed to showcase best practices in frontend and backend development with C#.

## üöÄ Description
BlazorStoreApp is a modern e-commerce web application where users can:
- Browse products with images, prices, and descriptions.
- Add products to an interactive shopping cart.
- View and manage the cart in real time (add, remove, clear items).
- Add new products (admin functionality).

The interface is responsive, visually appealing, and uses toast notifications for a great user experience.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Frontend in Blazor WebAssembly**: Reactive and fluid UI using components.
- **Global Cart**: Shared state and product counter in the main layout, always up to date.
- **Toast notifications**: Floating, centered messages for instant feedback.
- **Modern styles**: Bootstrap and component-scoped CSS.
- **REST API consumption**: Products and categories are fetched from [Fake Store API](https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/).
- **PWA Ready**: Installable as an app on mobile and desktop devices.
